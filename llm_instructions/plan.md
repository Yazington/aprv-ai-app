# Enhanced UI Improvement Plan

## 1. Modern Chat Interface Enhancements

- [x] Implement message bubbles with glassmorphism effect and dynamic utility classes for responsiveness
- [x] Utilize Tailwind's forced colors for accessibility compliance
- [x] Add parallax animations for message containers with Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- [ ] Implement CSS subgrid for better alignment of message components
- [ ] Create bento grid layout for message history using Tailwind's grid utilities
- [ ] Implement dark mode support for the chat interface
- [ ] Add 3D avatar icons with hover animations and use Tailwind's animation utilities for effects
- [ ] Implement message reactions with micro-interactions using Tailwind's transition utilities
- [ ] Optimize performance with Tailwind's JIT mode for faster load times
- [ ] Add message grouping by time/context with dynamic class generation for styling
- [ ] Implement smooth message transitions with Framer Motion and Tailwind's transition utilities

## 2. Advanced Input Section

- [ ] Add floating label pattern for textarea
- [ ] Implement voice-to-text transcription
- [ ] Add AI-assisted input suggestions
- [ ] Create adaptive input height with smooth resizing
- [ ] Add file preview thumbnails before upload
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop file upload
- [ ] Add input validation with animated feedback

## 3. Visual Design System
